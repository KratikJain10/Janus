# Janus

**A self-hostable, OpenAI-compatible LLM API gateway.**

One endpoint in front of any LLM provider — with the auth, rate limiting, caching, reliability, and cost tracking that production AI apps need but shouldn't rebuild.

## Why this exists

Real AI products rarely call provider APIs directly. They put a **gateway** in front to control cost, add reliability, and observe usage. Janus implements that gateway from scratch — the interesting engineering is the proxying, streaming, caching, rate limiting, failure handling, and observability, *not* the LLM call itself.

Named after the Roman god of gates, doorways, and transitions. 🏛️

## Highlights

- 🔌 **Drop-in OpenAI compatibility** — `POST /v1/chat/completions`, streaming and non-streaming. Point your existing OpenAI SDK at it.
- 🔑 **API-key auth** — client keys stored as SHA-256 hashes in Postgres (the plaintext key is shown once, never stored).
- 🚦 **Per-key rate limiting** — token bucket in Redis, evaluated atomically in a single Lua script so it's correct under concurrency.
- ⚡ **Two-layer caching** — exact-match (Redis, hashed request) and optional **semantic** (pgvector cosine search) that serves near-duplicate prompts.
- 🛟 **Reliability** — per-attempt timeout, retries with capped exponential backoff + jitter, automatic **fallback** to the next provider, and a per-provider **circuit breaker**.
- 📊 **Observability** — per-request tokens/latency/cost persisted to Postgres, a `/v1/usage` summary, Prometheus `/metrics`, and a minimal `/dashboard`.
- 🧩 **Provider-agnostic** — a provider is just config `{ name, baseUrl, apiKey }`. Adding one is config, not code.

## Architecture

```
Client
  │
  ▼
Fastify
  ├─ auth hook          validate client API key (Postgres)
  ├─ rate-limit hook    token bucket in Redis (atomic Lua)
  ├─ exact cache        Redis, hashed request           ──hit──▶ return
  ├─ semantic cache     pgvector cosine similarity       ──hit──▶ return
  ├─ router             pick provider + fallback order, circuit breaker
  │     └─ upstream     fetch( timeout → retry+backoff → fallback )
  ├─ response           SSE stream  OR  JSON
  └─ onResponse         persist tokens/latency/cost; record metrics
```

Auth and rate limiting are Fastify `preHandler` plugins; Redis and the Postgres pool are exposed via decorator plugins (`fastify.redis`, `fastify.pg`). The app is built (`buildApp`) separately from the server (`server.js`) so tests run against the real app via `fastify.inject()`.

## Tech stack

**Node.js** (ES modules) · **Fastify** · **pino** · **Redis** · **PostgreSQL** (`pg`, raw SQL) + **pgvector** · **zod** · native `fetch`/**undici** · **vitest** · **ESLint** + **Prettier** · **Docker Compose**.

## Quick start

```bash
# 1 — backing services (Redis + Postgres-with-pgvector)
docker compose up -d

# 2 — configure
cp .env.example .env          # set GROQ_API_KEY (free tier at console.groq.com)

# 3 — install, migrate, mint a client key
npm install
npm run migrate
npm run mint-key -- --name dev --rpm 100      # prints a jns_… key ONCE

# 4 — run (loads .env via --env-file)
npm run dev
```

### Make a request

```bash
curl http://localhost:3000/v1/chat/completions \
  -H 'content-type: application/json' \
  -H 'authorization: Bearer jns_your_key' \
  -d '{
    "model": "llama-3.1-8b-instant",
    "messages": [{ "role": "user", "content": "Say hello in one sentence." }]
  }'
```

Streaming is the same call with `"stream": true` — tokens arrive as Server-Sent Events:

```bash
curl -N http://localhost:3000/v1/chat/completions \
  -H 'content-type: application/json' -H 'authorization: Bearer jns_your_key' \
  -d '{"model":"llama-3.1-8b-instant","stream":true,
       "messages":[{"role":"user","content":"Count to five."}]}'
```

Responses carry gateway headers: `x-cache` (`HIT`/`MISS`), `x-cache-type` (`exact`/`semantic`), and `x-provider` (which upstream actually served the request).

## Endpoints

| Method | Path | Auth | Description |
| --- | --- | :---: | --- |
| `POST` | `/v1/chat/completions` | 🔑 | OpenAI-compatible; supports `stream: true` |
| `GET` | `/v1/usage` | 🔑 | Per-key usage + cost summary (totals + by-model) |
| `GET` | `/metrics` | — | Prometheus exposition (requests, latency histogram, cache hit ratio) |
| `GET` | `/dashboard` | — | Minimal web UI over `/v1/usage` + `/metrics` |
| `GET` | `/health` | — | Liveness |

## Configuration

Config comes entirely from the environment and is validated by **zod at startup** — the process fails fast with a clear message on anything missing or malformed (and never echoes secret values). Full list in [`.env.example`](.env.example); the essentials:

| Variable | Default | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `GROQ_API_KEY` | — | Primary upstream provider |
| `OLLAMA_BASE_URL` | — | Opt-in local fallback provider |
| `GROQ_MODELS` · `OLLAMA_MODELS` | — (wildcard) | Comma-separated models each provider serves; enables model-aware routing |
| `CACHE_ENABLED` · `CACHE_TTL_SECONDS` | `true` · `300` | Exact-match cache |
| `UPSTREAM_TIMEOUT_MS` · `UPSTREAM_MAX_RETRIES` | `30000` · `2` | Retry policy |
| `CIRCUIT_BREAKER_THRESHOLD` · `_COOLDOWN_MS` | `5` · `15000` | Per-provider circuit breaker |
| `SEMANTIC_CACHE_ENABLED` · `_THRESHOLD` | `false` · `0.95` | Semantic cache (requires `EMBEDDING_BASE_URL`) |

## Design decisions

A few choices worth calling out (the kind of thing this project is meant to demonstrate):

- **Fastify over Express** — lower per-request overhead for a throughput-oriented proxy, first-class streaming, and built-in pino logging + schema support.
- **Token bucket in one Lua script** — the entire check-refill-decrement runs server-side in Redis, so rate limiting stays correct under concurrent requests with no round-trip races.
- **Usage logged once, after fallback** — retries and provider fallback happen *below* the usage layer, so a request that fails over to a backup is billed once, to the provider that actually served it. Cache entries store the serving provider too, so a cache hit is attributed to whoever originally produced it.
- **Model-aware routing** — providers declare the models they serve (empty = wildcard); the router restricts the fallback chain to providers that can serve the requested model, so you can point a model at a specific upstream without taking another offline to force failover.
- **Fail-open caches, fail-fast config** — a Redis/embedding hiccup degrades to a normal upstream call rather than erroring; bad configuration crashes the process immediately at boot.
- **Streaming without buffering** — the upstream SSE stream is piped straight to the socket with backpressure; client disconnects abort the upstream so we stop paying for unread tokens. A passthrough tap reads the final `usage` chunk (via `stream_options.include_usage`) so streamed requests get exact token + cost accounting without buffering the response.

## Testing

```bash
npm test      # vitest — uses fastify.inject() with injected pg/redis fakes (no live infra)
npm run lint  # eslint
```

72 tests cover the proxy, streaming (incl. streamed token capture), auth, rate limiting, both cache layers, model-aware routing, retry/fallback/circuit-breaker semantics, cost computation, and the usage/metrics endpoints.

## Benchmarks

Measured locally (single Node process, Groq `llama-3.1-8b-instant`) — full method + raw output in [`bench/RESULTS.md`](bench/RESULTS.md):

| Path | Throughput | p50 | p99 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Cached** (gateway + Redis) | **1,542 req/s** | ~32 ms | 64 ms |
| **Uncached** (gateway → Groq) | upstream-bound¹ | 243 ms | 644 ms² |

At a **99.996%** cache hit ratio over a 15s run, hits returned ~8× faster than live calls and avoided ~all repeat upstream cost. Reproduce with `BENCH_KEY=jns_... bench/run.sh`.

¹ Uncached throughput is capped by Groq's free-tier tokens/min, not the gateway. ² p95 (autocannon/driver percentile).

## Roadmap

Backend is feature-complete, including model-aware routing, provider-attributed cache entries, and exact streamed-usage accounting. Natural next steps:

- Per-key model/route allow-lists and budget caps (hard spend limits, not just tracking)
- Weighted / latency-aware provider selection instead of fixed config order
- Half-open circuit-breaker probes so a recovered provider is retried before full cooldown elapses
